The game framework supports optimal environment design through an iterative and entertaining approach. A player can improve their design to reach optimality by iterating on subtle design modifications and running simulations.  Furthermore, the framework supports collaboration and competitive co-design by exposing players to other's designs and performance analyses.

We have also provided the user the ability to reinforce their design by learning from the best player's moves. One way that this is achieved is to show the best scorer's heatmap. A player can gain knowledge from that heatmap to potentially incrementally improve their design. By allowing players to iteratively replay and view other's analyses and designs the game fosters collaboration in our game which can guide player's to a more optimal architectural design.
