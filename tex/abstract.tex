Architectural design decisions stand to benefit by accounting for the presence and activities of human crowds that inhabit these spaces.  Computational methods for simulating synthetic crowds provide a cost effective means of exploring and analysing the design search space.  However, crowd-aware architectural design is a complex combinatorial decision process, where small changes in the design solution may affect crowds and their flow patterns in unexpected and potentially unintuitive ways. Existing solutions rely on expert intuition or automation, but are unable to account for many contradicting, and often subjective properties while optimizing designs. A single solution approach may also miss potential design solutions that achieve the desired objective specifications, while meeting subjective criteria.  We propose a means of combining these methods in a gamified framework. Using our system, ``players"  (novice users or experts) can rapidly iterate on their designs while soliciting feedback from computer simulations of crowd movement, as well as the designs of previous players. Our approach affords a new way of thinking of the solution space in that it inherently supports competitive co-design and crowd sourced solutions.  We evaluate our framework through a user study and demonstrate the potential of crowd-aware co-design of environments using simulation guided multiplayer games.
