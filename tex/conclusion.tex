Some of the short comings of our current game was that some of the levels were quite tedious. Layouts in each level are designed manually. It would much more effective if this process was automated. All agents behavior in the game is quite similar and it would make sense to provide different behaviors to different agents. The game also needs more advanced architectural standards to be included as constraints to help casual users' designs to meet these standards. Future work includes making the simulations as realistic as possible with improved agent behavior. Users can be provided with behavior elements to add to their crowd agents along with the current crowd configuration parameters.

We think that our game can help the knowledge of architectural design go beyond the boundaries of architectural experts and can make the task of architectural design more interesting and entertaining. We also believe this paper is a beginning of more future architectural researches using serious games.
