    abstract = {<p>A disastrous form of pedestrian behavior is a stampede occurring in an event involving a large crowd in a panic situation. To deal with such stampedes, the possibility to increase the outflow by suitably placing a pillar or some other shaped obstacles in front of the exit has been demonstrated. We present a social force based genetic algorithm to optimize the best design of architectural entities to deal with large crowds. Unlike existing literature, our simulation results indicate that appropriately placing two pillars on both sides but not in front of the door can maximize the escape efficiency. Human experiments using 80 participants correspond well with the simulations. We observed a peculiar property named tangential momentum, the escape speed and the tangential momentum are found to be negatively correlated. The idea to reduce the tangential momentum has practical implications in crowd architectural design.</p>},

	have been proposed and applied e.g. for design of egress routes.
	However, so far not much attention has been paid to their quantitative
	validation. This unsatisfactory situation belongs amongst others
	on the uncertain and contradictory experimental data base. The fundamental
	diagram, i.e. the density-dependence of the flow or velocity, is
	probably the most important relation as it connects the basic parameter
	to describe the dynamic of crowds. But specifications in different
	handbooks as well as experimental measurements differ considerably.
	The same is true for the bottleneck flow. After a comprehensive review
	of the experimental data base we give an survey of a research project,
	including experiments with up to 250 persons performed under well
	controlled laboratory conditions. The trajectories of each person
	are measured in high precision to analyze the fundamental diagram
	and the flow through bottlenecks. The trajectories allow to study
	how the way of measurement influences the resulting relations. Surprisingly
	we found large deviation amongst the methods. These may be responsible
	for the deviation in the literature mentioned above. The results
	are of particular importance for the comparison of experimental data
	gained in different contexts and for the validation of models.},
